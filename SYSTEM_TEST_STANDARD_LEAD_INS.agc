## Purpose:     A section of Comanche revision 045.
##              It is part of the reconstructed source code for the
##              second release of the flight software for the Command
##              Module's (CM) Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) for Apollo 10.
##              The code has been recreated from a copy of Comanche 055. It
##              has been adapted such that the resulting bugger words
##              exactly match those specified for Comanche 45 in NASA drawing
##              2021153D, which gives relatively high confidence that the
##              reconstruction is correct.

# E/BKCALL	FOR DOING BANKCALLS FROM AND RETURNING TO ERASABLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE IS CALLABLE FROM ERASABLE OR FIXED.  LIKE BANKCALL, HOWEVER, SWITCHING BETWEEN S3 AND S4
# IS NOT POSSIBLE.
#
# THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS:
#
#	TC	BANKCALL
#	CADR	E/BKCALL
#	CADR	ROUTINE		WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN FIXED.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY TERMINATE, BAD STALL OR TC Q.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY PROCEED OR GOOD RETURN FROM STALL.
#	RETURN HERE FROM DISPLAY ENTER OR RECYCLE.
#
# THIS ROUTINE REQUIRES TWO ERASABLES (EBUF2, +1) IN UNSWITCHED WHICH ARE UNSHARED BY INTERRUPTS AND
# OTHER EMEMORY PROGRAMS.
#
# A + L ARE PRESERVED THROUGH BANKCALL AND E/BKCALL.

		ADS	EBUF2	+1	# FORM BBCON.  (WAS FBANK)
		NDX	EBUF2

		TC	SWCALL		# GO TO ROUTINE, SETTING Q TO SWRETURN
					# AND RESTORING A + L.
